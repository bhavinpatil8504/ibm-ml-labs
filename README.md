# IBM ML Labs - Data Cleaning Notebook

This repo contains a cleaned and fully cleaned notebook from a lab of the IBM Machine Learning Certification course on Coursera. Specifically the subcourse "Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning". All the preprocessing steps are handled using "pandas" and "numpy.

## 📝When you open the notebook, you will see:
- Clear Markdown explanations
- Step by Step Data Cleaning
- Reproducible code snippets

  ## 💡Purpose
  This is a part of my hands-on Machine Learning portfolio. I'm sharing this to demonstrate the skills that I have learnt in data wrangling and preprocessing
